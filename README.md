This is a web application for Lab 3 in course 1DV610. The app allows users to save, view, delete, and manage a collection of recipe links. It helps users easily store and organize their recipes in one place for future reference.

## Recipe Manager

The Recipe Manager lets users store links to recipes they want to try, along with a title for easy identification. It also includes functionality to view, delete, and clear all saved recipes, providing an efficient and organized way to manage recipes.

### Key Features

- **Delete Recipes**: Users can delete individual recipes they no longer need or want to keep in the list.
- **Clear All Recipes**: An option to delete all saved recipes at once for easy management of large collections.
- **Recipe Notifications**: Whenever a recipe is successfully added or deleted, users receive a notification confirming the action.

### Upcoming Features & Enhancements

- **Search Bar**: A search functionality is planned for a future update, which will allow users to filter recipes by title for easier searching.
- **Recipe Notifications**: Users will get visual or text-based notifications when actions such as adding, deleting, or clearing recipes are successfully performed.

- **Recipe Categories**: Future versions may allow users to categorize their recipes (e.g., Desserts, Main Dishes, Vegan) for easier organization.
- **Recipe Details**: In the future, users might be able to add additional information for each recipe, such as ingredients or preparation time, for better reference.
